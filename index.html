<h1>My Github Portfolio!</h1>
<p>
<br>
My name is Nia Anderson and I am a Digital Media major. I have experience with multiple coding languages: C, Java, and Python. I also know site development and SQL database management. My coursework includes American Sign Language; Tools for Digital Humanities; Digital Cultures and Humanities; and Evolution of Video Games. One of my recent projects was a metroidvania apart of the UCF 2025 Knight Hacks Hackathon.

<h2>Why Github?</h2>  
    <p>This is just one more skill that can help you stand out in the job market! There is a big push for technical documents to be treated as code–and even to write them in the same software as code–for software and technical companies. Plus, Github pages use Markdown, which is another impressive skill for your resume.
